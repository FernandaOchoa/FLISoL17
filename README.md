## About 🕹

This is a Python 🐍 workshop for the *Festival Latinoamericano de Instalación de Software Libre 2017* for which I was invited at the *Instituto Tecnológico de León*. It is basically a workshop about some Python basics, focused on image manipulation.

I don't use any lib other than `NumPy` and `Matplotlib` to manipulate images, since I was asked to teach through the basics. Even tho, I programmed some image derivatives (sobel X and sobel Y) to illustrate some image processing, and programmed some fractals.

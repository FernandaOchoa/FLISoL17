## About 🕹

This is a Python 🐍 workshop for the *Festival Latinoamericano de Instalación de Software Libre 2017* for which I was invited at the *Instituto Tecnológico de León*. It is basically a workshop about some Python basics, focused on image manipulation.

I don't use any lib other than `NumPy` and `Matplotlib` to manipulate images, since I was asked to teach through the basics. Even tho, I programmed some image derivatives (sobel X and sobel Y) to illustrate some image processing, and programmed some fractals.


## Setup

You can download Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For this workshop, version 3.6 is recommended. (We will use operators like `@`.)

> If you're installing Python on Windows, just remember to check the "Add Python to PATH" little box during the installation.

We also need to install [NumPy](http://numpy.org) and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org).

#### Installing NumPy and Matplotlib

To install `numpy` and `matplotlib` we will use `pip`. After installing Python, open a terminal and type the following:
```
$ pip install numpy
```

After this, now type the following:
```
$ pip install matplotlib
```

> If you want not only to install this libs on your user, but in the whole system, use `sudo`.
